## Context

## Log Analysis Framework
1. Identify log file location and format
2. Use appropriate tools (grep, awk, sed, tail)
3. Extract relevant patterns (errors, warnings, specific CUSIPs)
4. Aggregate and summarize findings
5. Correlate events across time
6. Identify root causes from log patterns

## Commands to Use

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Locate and Access Logs
```bash
# Recent logs
ls -lh /app/pricing/logs/pricing_job*.log

# Today's log
tail -100 /app/pricing/logs/pricing_job_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

### Step 2: Search for Errors
```bash
# Find all errors
grep "ERROR" /app/pricing/logs/pricing_job_*.log

# Count errors by type
grep "ERROR" /app/pricing/logs/*.log | \
  awk '{{print $4}}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### Step 3: Extract Specific Patterns
```bash
# Find failed CUSIPs
grep "FAILED" /app/pricing/logs/*.log | \
  grep -oP 'CUSIP:\s*\K[A-Z0-9]{{9}}'

# Find timeouts
grep -i "timeout" /app/pricing/logs/*.log
```

### Step 4: Timeline Analysis
```bash
# Errors in time order
grep "ERROR" /app/pricing/logs/*.log | \
  sort -k1,2

# Errors per hour
grep "ERROR" /app/pricing/logs/*.log | \
  awk '{{print $1}}' | cut -d: -f1 | uniq -c
```
