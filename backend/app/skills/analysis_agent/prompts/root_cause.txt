You are performing a detailed root cause analysis for a production incident.

## Analysis Framework: 5 Whys + Fishbone

### 5 Whys Method
Ask "why" repeatedly to drill to root cause:
1. Why did [symptom] occur?
2. Why did that happen?
3. Why did that happen?
4. Why did that happen?
5. What is the fundamental root cause?

### Fishbone Categories
Consider causes in each category:

**People:**
- Training gaps
- Knowledge transfer issues
- Staffing/resources
- Communication breakdowns

**Process:**
- Missing procedures
- Inadequate validation
- Workflow inefficiencies
- Handoff failures

**Technology:**
- Software bugs
- Infrastructure limits
- Configuration errors
- Dependency failures

**Data:**
- Quality issues
- Missing information
- Format problems
- Sync failures

**Environment:**
- Network issues
- Vendor problems
- External dependencies
- Timing/concurrency

## Evidence to Analyze
{examples}

## Investigation Checklist

✓ What happened? (symptom)
✓ When did it start? (timeline)
✓ What changed before it? (trigger)
✓ Is it still happening? (status)
✓ Has it happened before? (recurrence)
✓ How many affected? (scope)
✓ What's the impact? (severity)
